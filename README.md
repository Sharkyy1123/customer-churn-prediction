The term customer churn denotes whenever a customer discontinues utilizing a company's product or service. Businesses use predictions regarding customer churn to guide their efforts when developing preventive solutions, including developing specific or targeted promotional offers, providing enhanced customer support, and creating personalized ways of engaging customers.

This project will involve performing a thorough examination of a large dataset of customers, utilizing machine-learning techniques such as classification and regression to assess how a customer may respond to product or service offerings based on the customer's demographic characteristics (age, ethnicity, etc. ) as well as their usage of a given product/service and the terms under which they paid for their product/service.

The method of performing the above is through a step-by-step ML pipeline, beginning with data analysis and continuing through the application of classical ML models and, possibly, some advanced ML techniques.
